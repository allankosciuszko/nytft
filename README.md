#### Disclaimer 
I implemented task in python for educational purposes as I have more likely Java background.
Therefore many things are not optimal and normally would need further improvements:
- security tests
- performance tests
- improve response validation
- validation of requests quota 


### Description 
I generated python api client with latest swagger-codegen: https://swagger.io/docs/open-source-tools/swagger-codegen/


#### Before 
python setup.py install --user  

### Sample run

```python

export NYFT_API_KEY=yourApiKEY
python ./test/test/test_most_emailed_article.py    

```
